VACCOVID.LIVE was a comprehensive and up-to-date website that served as a tracker for vaccines, COVID-19, and treatments. It was launched with the aim of providing information to people worldwide regarding the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

This website was my first project; therefore, it may lack proper organization.

Here is a teaser for the VACCOVID website:
