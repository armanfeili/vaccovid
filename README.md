# VACCOVID Website

VACCOVID.LIVE was a comprehensive, up-to-date Vaccine, COVID-19, and Treatment tracker website. It had been launched to inform people throughout the planet about the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

This website was my first project. Therefore it is not well-organized.
