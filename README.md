# VACCOVID Website 
VACCOVID.LIVE was a comprehensive and up-to-date website that served as a tracker for vaccines, COVID-19, and treatments. It was launched with the aim of providing information to people worldwide regarding the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Since this website was my initial undertaking, it might not possess the optimal level of organization.

Who are we?  Our team includes 2 programmers and 1 medical doctor, all from Iran, Shiraz city. We have been working for 6 months to provide this easy-to-use tracker.

A quick intro clip:

## Purpose: 
VACCOVID.LIVE is a comprehensive up-to-date Vaccine tracker, COVID-19 tracker and Treatment tracker website which has been landed to inform people throughout the planet about the present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We accomplished this duty by providing the latest reliable data from several APIs. In VACCOVID you can also find the most relevant and up-to-date news about covid-19. We have tried to gather and illustrate the latest statistical data known about covid-19 in tangible tables using evidence based and professional conceptual framework.  

# Features:
## Covid-19 Tracker: 
We fetch and update covid-19 data every 5 minutes from 3 different APIs, which can help us to keep the tracker, up-to-date and accurate. We are honored to claim that we provide the essential COVID-19 statistical data of all 219 countries of the entire world separately. We also provide the coronavirus statistical data of all states of 23 countries which include United States of America, Canada, India, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, China, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Mexico, Peru, Pakistan, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine.
(Special thanks to Postman company that provided all essential APIs for every covid-19 cases.) 

The visual data you can observe in each table, are separated to the following columns: Total cases, New Case, Active Cases, Serious or Critical Cases, Total Deaths, New Deaths, Total Tests and Total Recovered. In order to have a deeper and epidemiological analysis, we have added 4 measurement items named Infection risk, Case fatality rate (CFR), Test percentage and Recovery percentage for each country and state. 

In addition, you can see the data tracks from the past six months on visual charts in order to realize the trends on Total and New cases or deaths of each country, through the time. You can also compare each country's data with average world status.

We tried our best to demonstrate all these data in the most straightforward and user-friendly way, so any visitor can get the most of their observation from any section on their own devices.

## Vaccine Tracker: 
Thanks to FasterCures (Milken institute) we could gather latest data about more than 230 developing vaccines. The following information is available about each vaccine; 
The clinical stage,
The description of vaccine product,
Following steps that the company should take for getting into the next phase,
FDA approval in order to show that which vaccine has the eligibility to get into the market for public use,
The Last time that the producing company revealed their results,
Specific links to the results of each vaccine progress.

vaccines are organized according to clinical stage and production platform. We have also specified links to the vaccines that have more potential to reach phase 4 and get the FDA approval.
You can see the complete information and results for that specific vaccine, by a click on any vaccine name.

## Treatment Tracker: 
The same as vaccine tracker, we provide data from the same resource, FasterCures. Treatments are organized based on clinical stage and development platform. 

We have also specified the links to the most frequently used medications which are currently utilized to treat covid-19 cases and have more potential than other treatments to get FDA approval.  
You can see the complete information and results about any specific medication, by a click on any treatment name.

## Articles: 
This part is a covid-specific blog that provides reviews and analytical articles about recent discoveries, epidemiologic findings and effects of the disease on different aspects of our life.

## News: 
We gather the most relevant coronavirus news from more than 20 well-founded broadcasting services with the most reliable sources for fresh coronavirus news and update them every 5 hours. The WHO (World Health Organization) news is placed at the top of other services which include CNN, BBC, FOX-news, TIME, MNT(Medical-News-Today), Bloomberg, ABC-news, CBS-news, CBC-news, NBC-news, USA Today, New Scientist, National Geographic, Google news, News24, Next Big Future, The Times of India, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Axios. 

## Maps: 
Here you can find an abstract visual information about covid-19 cases on maps. Not only we are covering the world map, but also we provide information for entire states of several countries including United States of America, Canada, Brazil, Germany and Australia. Since we have data from all covid-19 cases from 23 countries, we are trying to develop this part and add more countries with full information on their map in near future.
Each country or state has been distinguished from other countries and states by colors based on the total cases. 

Impacts: Coming soon!

We hope that VACCOVID.LIVE help communities to stay safe and aware of the disease to prepare for future challeges…


# ALL Vaccines
Here you can find all the developing or approved vaccines in every phase. You can always sort the table, based on any columns, or search for a unique vaccine name.
FDA Approved
it means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that the benefits of the product outweigh the known risks for the intended use.

## RNA Based
This is a form of nucleic acid vaccine technology. This is the newest technology in vaccine producing industry and has been only used for making corona virus vaccines. Instead of a virus, a protein antigen, or a virus expressing the protein, nucleic acid coding for the antigen is injected. mRNA responsible for corona spike protein is encased in a lipid coat and injected into the body. mRNA acts more directly but is less stable than DNA vaccines. Compared with the viral-vector platform, the mRNA provides the most specific and minimal immunogenic response which allows repeated administration of the vaccine.

## DNA Based
This is a form of nucleic acid vaccine technology. This is the newest technology in vaccine producing industry and has been only used for making corona virus vaccines. Instead of a virus, a protein antigen, or a virus expressing the protein, nucleic acid coding for the antigen is injected. DNA plasmid enters nucleus and is translated to mRNA for expression of protein. DNA based vaccines provide more stable and long-term immunity.

## Inactivated Virus
Whole inactivated virus is in fact the dead virus which induces strong antibody response. The problem is that this platform needs large quantities of virus for production. The examples so far are vaccines for Influenza, rabies hepatitis A.

## Live Attenuated Virus
Attenuated live virus induces same response as natural infection but is not recommended for pregnant women and immunocompromised persons as it is possible that the weak virus develops the disease. The examples so far are vaccines for Measles, rubella, mumps, yellow fever and smallpox.

## Replicating Viral Vector
The gene for a pathogen protein (most commonly the corona virus spike gene) is inserted into a different virus that can infect someone without causing disease. The safe virus serves as a ‘platform’ or ‘vector’ to deliver the protein that triggers an immune response. The safe virus is then injected as a vaccine. Some viral vectors replicate (reproduce) in the body and some do not.

## Non-Replicating Viral Vector
The gene for a pathogen protein (most commonly the corona virus spike gene) is inserted into a different virus that can infect someone without causing disease. The safe virus serves as a ‘platform’ or ‘vector’ to deliver the protein that triggers an immune response. The safe virus is then injected as a vaccine. Some viral vectors replicate (reproduce) in the body and some do not.

## Replicating Bacterial Vector
The gene for a pathogen protein (most commonly the corona virus spike gene) is inserted into a bacterium that can infect someone without causing disease. The safe bacteria serve as a ‘platform’ or ‘vector’ to deliver the protein that triggers an immune response. This platform is not popular among covid-19 vaccine platforms.

## Virus-Like Particle
This is a category of Protein-based vaccines. A protein-based vaccine is based on the synthetic peptides or recombinant antigenic proteins. A protein is extracted from the virus (alive or inactivated), purified, and injected as a vaccine. 
For coronavirus the S-Protein and its antigenic fragments are the prime targets for the institution of the subunit vaccine.  The extracted proteins may be introduced directly into the body (protein-subunit vaccine) or may be placed on a lipid-like structure that mimics the virus (Virus-Like Particle or VLP). The problem is that memory for future responses is doubtful.

The problem is that memory for future responses is doubtful.

Pre-clinical studies According to WHO, Vaccine is tested in animal studies for efficacy and safety, including challenge studies

### • Phase I clinical trial: Small groups of healthy adult volunteers receive the vaccine to test for safety.
The subject who receives the vaccine is observed until several half-lives of the vaccine have passed. During this phase, the researchers assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a vaccine. In addition, Phase I clinical trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation studies, so that the best and safest dose can be found and the safety window of the vaccine can be estimated.

### • Phase II clinical trial: Vaccine is given to people who have characteristics (such as age and physical health) similar to those for whom the new vaccine is intended.
In Phase II the goal is to test whether the drug has any biological activity or effect. About 50-300 volunteers are assigned to participate. This phase includes 2 steps; first determining clinical efficacy or biological activity ('proof of concept' studies) and second determine the optimal dose at which the drug shows biological activity with minimal side-effects (‘definite dose-finding’ studies)

### • Phase III clinical trial: 
Vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety. Phase III studies are randomized controlled multicenter trials during which, the vaccine is given to a number of 300-3000 healthy people to investigate the definite efficacy and effectiveness. It is also called the "pre-marketing phase" because it actually measures consumer response to the vaccine.

### • Phase IV:
This phase is also called post marketing surveillance. Ongoing studies after the vaccine is approved and licensed, to monitor adverse events and to study long-term effects of the vaccine in the population


# ALL Treatments

## FDA Approved
it means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that the benefits of the product outweigh the known risks for the intended use.

## Antibodies
Antibodies are a key component of the body’s natural immune response to invading pathogens. In case of Covid-19, the antibodies can directly bind to viral proteins and prevent the virus from replicating.  There are 2 ways to provide the patient with exogenous antibodies. One way is by using blood plasma from people who are recovering from COVID-19 to transfer the antibodies that they have produced to someone else. This method is called convalescent plasma therapy.  Another is to manufacture and mass-produce specific antibodies against the virus that could supplement the body’s immune response. The resulting medications are called monoclonal antibodies.

## Antivirals
There are many medications which have shown whether in vivo or in vitro antiviral effects against SARS-COV2. These drugs either destroy the virus directly or prevent the virus from attachment, infecting the cells or replication.  

## Cell-based Therapies
In this method, some human cell lineages are prepared or cultured in lab. Infusing these cells into a covid-19 patient can boost immune system or prevent lethal inflammatory process during the disease course. Examples so far include Natural killer (NK), Dendritic cells (DN), and exosomes. In addition Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their pro/anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory behavior have been promising in moderate to severe stages of the disease when the lethal cytokine storm is about to begin.

## RNA Based
This method is a branch of a novel therapeutic approach called Nucleic acid-based therapies. In addition to mRNA, we have several other types of RNA which are able to carry instructions for making proteins, help to turn genes on and off, aid chemical reactions, slice and dice other RNAs, and even build proteins. Most RNA therapies can be sorted into one of three broad categories: those that target nucleic acids (either DNA or RNA), those that target proteins, and those that encode proteins. RNA-based therapies like RNAi (RNA interference), siRNAs (small interfering RNA) and RNA aptamers, Ribozymes and ASOs (antisense oligonucleotides) target and neutralize the crucial components of the virus-like specific mRNA molecules, viral proteins like E (envelope), M (membrane), or N (nucleocapsid), or SARS helicase, etc.

## Device
Some devices are introduced for decreasing the lethal consequences of covid-19. These include Extracorporeal Blood Purification devices that are able to clean inflammatory cytokines from blood, Devices for directly inhaling Nitric Oxide, Artificial Heart pump in those who have Right heart failure due to pulmonary emboli, vagus nerve stimulation device to alleviate respiratory distress in some patients, etc.

## Scanning Compounds to Repurpose
Multiple research teams and institutes have systematically scanned all present drug molecules that can theoretically affect SARS-COV2 pathogenesis. These systematic scanning attempts were conducted on drugs either in clinical phase or FDA approved. Such attempts have led to some promising therapies like remdesivir, Lopinavir, Hydroxychloroquie, Baricitinib, etc. This section provides the description of these scans.

## Clinical phase
After preclinical research, tests and treatments go through a series of clinical trials. Clinical trials assess if tests or treatments are safe for and work in people

## Pre-Clinical Phase
The preclinical stage in drug development industry begins before clinical trials (testing in humans), and during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, typically in laboratory animals. The main goals of preclinical studies are to determine a starting, safe dose for first-in-human study and assess potential toxicity of the product.
