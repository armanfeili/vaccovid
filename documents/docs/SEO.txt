SEO = Search Engine Optimization
a keyword doesn't have to ba just a word like: 'wordpress themes'
or 'Free responsive Wordpress themes for blog'

the long keywords are more recommended

go to keyword planner: https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ae/home/tools/keyword-planner/
to get the right keywords

***
we need to find words with 
'competition = Low' & 'Maximum Monthly searches >= 1000' 

you can write a vraiety of words to get their competition,
or you can enter a website name and click on 'Use only this page' to get the keywords from that page

then you can download results as .CVS file
we need just first 5 columns so delete all other columns and format the file as table.
then right click on 'Max search volume', and filter it by 'greater or equal to = 1000'.

google trends:
https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US
open menu and click on Explore. start adding search terms

another tool is Ubersuggest:https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/
when you set a word and specified the region, if the 'SEO DIFFICULTY' was lower than 35, you can use the word.
but if it was more than 35, you should go for a longer keyword with that word
go to 'keyword ideas page' and set filter as minimum search value as 1000 and SEO DIFFICULTY as 35. click on apply
you should add these filters to the given keywords:
position filter <= 5
SEO DIFFICULTY <= 36
Volume >= 1000

even after you found the keywords, check them again with google ads.

another source is keyword tool: https://keywordtool.io/google
another is: http://www.seobook.com/
another:https://www.semrush.com/

by going to 'Google.com/ncr' , you can find the related words.
ncr = no country redirect

How to find top ranking keywords of your site?

you can use Search Console in Google Webmaster tool:
https://search.google.com/search-console/about

then you can insert your website name, and find out which keywords were more popular among 
your keywords recently.
you can set position filter to see which keywords you positioned first before

we have 3 types of long words: Informational Transactional General
Informational: your searching for information: How to use smartphone
Transactional: you want the best advice or the best site which has the products with lowest price : Buy graphic card online
General: ecommerce wordpress website

when you used these long keywords and after a while got backlinks from more authority websites,
you can use short keywords.

spyfu helps you to get information from your competitor websites.
it also shows the other competitor to the website:
https://www.spyfu.com/

the next tool is Alexa:
https://www.alexa.com/

SimilarWeb is also the best tool for comparing sites based on similarity or Rank

-------------------------------------------------------------

On Paage Optimization:
keyword selection
Meta Description Tags
Header Tags
Title Tags
Content
H1 Tags
Alt Tags
Unique Content
Internal Link

most of the websites have h1 tags in themselves, we should use them too 
but if we use h2, we can get higher competitive advantages
keep have 1 <h1> to your entire posts and assign multiple h2 and h3 to several otherr headings

when a similar post is in both high authority website and a new website, google gives the higher ranking to
the higher authority website
we should also use meta description for all of our posts.

If you want to buy a domain name, don't look for the keyword. instead
choose a good brand name and develope the brand name. so people will search the direct domain name.

to increase domain seo visibility, it should have 2 important things:
1.  number of backlinks from high authority domains. so you should have pages for your brand name in all social medias
    and link them to the website: facebook, pintrest, google+
    the website 'moz.com' gives all the authority score.
    https://moz.com/
    just like:
    https://moz.com/domain-analysis?site=https%3A%2F%2Fncov2019.live%2F

    and searchmetrics also shows the visibility score.
    https://www.searchmetrics.com/

2.  Direct domain name searches

EMD: Exact Matched Domain       wordpress
PMD: Partial Matched Domain     word + press

https is a SEO signal and needs to buy 10 to 100$ SSL certificate.
goDaddy will sell it
google recommends TLS means SSL plus Certificate

url length of the site, should be short
loading time is a really factor for SEO. it should be lower than 2s.
check it with PageSpeed insight

KyeCDN, MaxCDN, Google CDN, Amazon AWS, Rackspace

CloudFlare is not just a CDN, it also optimize your content

we need to declare our sitemap:

What is the use of sitemap?
A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are 
important in your site, and also provides valuable information 
about these files: for example, for pages, when the page was 
last updated, how often the page is changed, and any alternate 
language versions of a page.

In simple terms, an XML sitemap is a list of your website's 
URLs. It acts as a roadmap to tell search engines what content 
is available and how to reach it. In the example above, a search 
engine will find all nine pages in a sitemap with one visit to 
the XML sitemap file.

How to add your website to Alexa:

Are external links bad for SEO?
While there are still some unanswered questions, this study 
seems to show that including outbound links to high authority 
sites can help your SEO efforts. At the very least, it won't 
hurt your SEO, so if you're hesitant to link out to other 
sites, just consider these results.

also you should use Internal Links. 
like Top Posts, Recent Posts, Categories, ... 
add 1 internal link per 100 words. like: if you haven't read my xyz post, click here to read it

***
if you use more images, it helps to your SEO.
if you want to use images from google, you should search images for a word, 
and set filter as 'labbeled for reuse'. so you can easily use
them with no copyright restriction

these days it's not a good idea to have video in your website.
but if you add a video from youtube, you make your audiance to stay more in your website.
so it will be a good point.

another factor is Intractive Elements.
like navbar or recent post to encourage users to intract more with your website.
you can also encourage them to make a comment under your posts. and let them to sign up with google
so they won't be that lazy

try to use un-orderd lists. they are user-friendly and more readably
having Tables in your site or deviding paragraphs to un-ordered lists are the things to
consider for SEO

***
put your Ads, Bellow to fold. it means the places where user can see 
with scrolling. Once you have imporved your brand authority, or domain seo visibility,
you can add 1 Ad in the header, 1 Ad in sidebar, inside the content
add 1 or 2 ads, in your Maximum limit of the page
don't force users to click on your Ad.(pop up window) because if you are using google AdSence,
you will get banned.

3 User signals:
1. Clicks
2. Time on site
3. Bounce rate: the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page

CTR: Click per Impression(who haved view). we should use google search analysis

canonical tag:
A canonical tag (aka "rel canonical") is a way of telling 
search engines that a specific URL represents the master copy 
of a page. Using the canonical tag prevents problems caused 
by identical or "duplicate" content appearing on multiple URLs.

You should be adding a canonical tag wherever you have 
duplicate content on your site. Similar content: Let's say 
you have an e-commerce store with products that are very 
similar but may have slight differences between them. In 
this case, most SEO experts say you should use canonical tags.
